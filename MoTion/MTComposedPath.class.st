Composed path enables path traversal using the '>' operator between properties. This allows to chain multiple properties in a pattern. Such paths help reducing complex patternâ€™s expression, by accessing a chain of objects and their properties:
The following pattern first matches an instance of 'ClassA', then it takes the object in its `property1` and the value in `property2` of this second object. This value should match `aValue`.
```
ClassA % {
	#'property1>property2' <=> aValue.
}
```

This notation allows expressing in a concise way a path in a graph of objects. The same result could be obtained with the pattern:
```
ClassA % {
	#'property1' <=> Object %% {
		#'property2' <=> aValue
	}
}
```
Note that the '>' operator is also polymorphic. Similarly to '<=>', if one of the objects in the path is a collection, the operator will look for an element of this collection that allows to continue the search, that is to say that has a property matching the remaining part of the pattern.
