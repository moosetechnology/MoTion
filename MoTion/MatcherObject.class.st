"
To define an object pattern, one specifies its type using the Pharo class followed by the percentage or double percentage operator like in: `ClassA % {}``. ‘%’ matches direct instances of the class, whereas ‘%%’ matches instances of the class or any of its subclasses.

These two operators can express sub-patterns and the properties of the matched object inside the curly braces. Object properties are instance variable accessors. The curly braces act as a conjunction of sub-patterns specifying the values that properties should match. It can be seen as a Logical matcher.
The following pattern matches an object of class `ClassA`, with a property `property1` having the value `aValue1`, and `property2` having `aValue2`:
```
ClassA % {
   #'property1' <=> aValue1.
   #'property2' <=> aValue2.
}
```
The sub-patterns could also be more complex (Nested pattern). This mechanism contributes to the seamless addition of various properties, in a declarative way.

The percentage, combined with the SpaceShip operator, also allows to express Nested pattern where a first object is matched, then a second object in one of the properties of the first is matched. One may express a sub-pattern on this second object. For example, the following pattern matches an instance of `ClassA` with `aValue1` in its `property1`, and an instance of `ClassB` in its `property2`. This second object must have `aValue3` in its `property3`.

```
ClassA % {
	#'property1' <=> aValue1.
	#'property2' <=> ClassB %% {
		#'property3' <=> aValue3.
	}
}
```
